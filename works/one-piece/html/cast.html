                    <h3>Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
                    <p>Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ Monkī Dī Rufi) is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series.
                        At age seven , he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks.
                        Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit
                        (ゴムゴムの実 Gomu Gomu no Mi),
                        which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into
                        grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him.
                        After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and
                        become King of the Pirates.
