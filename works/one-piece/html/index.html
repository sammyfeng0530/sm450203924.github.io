                            volumes to date. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
                            gained
                            the properties of rubber after

                            Luffy explores the Grand Line in

                            specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a trading
                            card
                            game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release
